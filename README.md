# How to get Ditdash
This is the way I recommend, but there are other methods of sideloading, such as AltStore/SideStore.
1. Install [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io) and all of its requirements; if I remember correctly on macOS there are none, but on Windows you will need iTunes and iCloud **not** from the Microsoft Store for it to work. All requirements are listed on the Sideloadly website!
2. From the [Releases](https://github.com/ConsciousBone/Ditdash/releases/tag/stable) tab (located on the right of the repo page on desktop, and at the bottom of the repo page on mobile), locate the latest release of Ditdash - it should be the first one at the top - and download the attached `Ditdash.ipa` file.
3. Connect your device (iPhone or iPad) to your computer, and trust it if prompted. If you do not get prompted to trust your computer, you may be using a cable which does not support data transfer, or you may already have trusted your device in the past.
4. Open Sideloadly, then click the button with the file icon and the "IPA" text and select the downloaded `Ditdash.ipa` file.
5. In the `iDevice` dropdown, select the device you wish to install Ditdash to, ensuring the name matches.
6. In the `Apple ID` text field, enter the email for your Apple Account/ID. If this is a paid developer account, you will need to resign/reinstall Ditdash once every 365 days; however if you are using a free developer account, you will need to resign/reinstall Ditdash once every 7 days.
7. Click `Start`, and enter your Apple Account/ID's password when prompted to. **Your password never gets sent to either me or the Sideloadly developers - only Apple ever sees it.**
8. Wait for the app to install to your device, then launch it! *You may be required to enable Developer Mode for the app to open, do so if your device prompts you to.*

# Inspiration
I have always been interested in morse code, and with this week's theme being *Signal* I felt that it was the perfect time to give it a go and see what I can do!

# Tech stack
- Swift (of course, its what like every iOS/iPadOS app is written in)
- SwiftUI (used for the UI of Ditdash, incredible piece of software btw ty Apple)
